EmployeeCare is a modern HR Management System designed to streamline HR operations, enhance employee engagement, and facilitate efficient workforce management. The system is being developed for a medium-sized company with around 500 employees. The HR department aims to centralize employee information, automate processes, and provide self-service functionalities.

Each employee has a unique Employee ID used as their primary identifier in the system. The system maintains essential employee details such as Name, Date of Birth, Gender, Address, Contact Information, and Email Address. Additionally, the system stores the Employee's Joining Date, Job Title, and Department.

The company has various departments, and each department has multiple job roles. Each job role is assigned a unique Job Role ID, along with its Title and Description. The system captures the hierarchy by specifying a Manager ID for each employee, indicating their reporting relationship.

Employees mark their attendance through the system on a daily basis. The system records the Attendance Date, Arrival Time, and Departure Time. The system also manages leaves, allowing employees to request leaves, specifying the Leave Type (e.g., vacation, sick leave), Leave Start Date, and Leave End Date. The system calculates leave balances based on company policies.

Employee salaries are managed through the system. Each employee's Salary, along with other compensation components like Bonuses and Allowances, is recorded. The Payroll module processes salaries based on attendance records and deductions. The system generates Pay Slips, detailing the salary breakdown.

The HR team uses the system for recruitment activities. Job openings are posted with Job ID, Title, and Description. Applicants apply online, providing their Resume, Contact Information, and Educational Qualifications. HR staff members review applications, schedule interviews, and track the status of candidates. Once hired, new employees' details are entered into the system during the onboarding process.

The Employee Self-Service portal enables employees to view and update their personal information, apply for leaves, and access their pay slips. The Manager Self-Service portal allows managers to view their team's attendance records, approve leave requests, and access team members' profiles.
